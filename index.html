            <h1>Morana Kenovar</h1>
            <p>The icy, composed heir of the Winter Court, Morana is the daughter of Lady Virelle and Lord Caedros. Scarred by a childhood of emotional abuse, Morana is known for her deliberate, careful speech—her mother wielded words like weapons, so Morana learned to wield silence as armor. She appears cold to most, but beneath is a deeply protective, loyal soul. Her moral compass is strong and quiet, often guiding her to act where others hesitate. She is feared for her precision, admired for her restraint. When the Winter Court was besieged, her enemies thought the castle vanished—she had hidden it in plain sight through powerful perception-altering magic.</p>

            <h1>Emrys</h1>
            <p>A roguish, charming force of chaos and compassion. Emrys comes from the Court of Nightmares but doesn’t fit their reputation. He adopts the broken, the outcast, the unwanted—and creates families from fractured souls. He’s loud, disarming, and joyfully unpredictable. But he carries deep trauma, often masked by jokes and rebellion. During a thunderstorm, he found Fynn sobbing inside a hollow tree and stayed with them the entire night, gently soothing them with stories. That’s who Emrys is: a storm-dancer who finds the forgotten.</p>

            <p>PEmrys’s younger sister, fiercely intelligent and soft-hearted. She has two rare pet dragons: Nyx, a mouse-sized stealthy telepath with sarcasm to spare, and Seth, a cat-sized lovable goofball who communicates through body language. Nyx begrudgingly translates for Seth, often misinterpreting on purpose. Kaida trains them both and uses them in espionage and companionship. She lives in the Court of Nightmares and is as clever as she is kind.</p>

            <p>Daughter of Tavros, the tyrannical Lord of the Autumn Court. Tavros wanted a son; Aspen was a disappointment he never let forget it. He forces her to enact his cruel judgments—even executions—under the guise of toughening her up. But Aspen is gentle, drawn to books, forests, and truth. Her magic allows her to detect lies instinctively and speak honest truths into reality, causing forests to bloom or danger to be warded. She’s a prisoner of law and duty, a soul of compassion in a court of stone.</p>

            <p>Aspen’s half-brother. A soft-spoken, autistic dryad-faeblood who is selectively mute, Auggie communicates through ink-based magic. He draws in the air with black ink that lingers, using shapes and runes to express himself. He can also read the emotional intent behind anything written in ink—even ancient scrolls—and often knows the nature of a book without opening it. Dutiful, kind, and deeply insightful, he leaves snacks for scribes and smiles even when he’s hurting. He has a mate named Hazel and finds joy in library work, Emrys’s friendship, and quiet acts of care.</p>

            <h1>Nyala</h1>
            <p>Born of flame and forged in cruelty, Nyala is a Summer Court baker who hides a harrowing past. Her mother was a warlord who saw her as a weapon. She collared Nyala to suppress her fire magic, sold her to enemy camps, and handed them the key—allowing them to abuse her before unleashing her like a Trojan horse of fire and death. Her blood is molten; alcohol and poison burn out in her veins. Her kill count is the highest of any character. She eventually escaped and was taken in by a poor village where her father runs a bakery. Now, Nyala gardens, bakes, paints, and gives warmth to others. The village loves her like one of their own. She can’t bear to be touched by any man, including her father, but expresses care through food, blankets, flowers, and art. When someone she loves is in danger, she snaps back into the lethal being her mother created. Her real name is Nyala Elpis, a soft name given by her father. Her mother only ever called her Hellfire.</p>

            <p>The gentle younger sister of Selah, made mute by a lifetime of being silenced, ignored, and bullied. An alchemist and green tea enthusiast, Nevaeh mixes herbs, potions, and sometimes accidentally her tea ingredients. She chews her hair when anxious and refuses alcohol religiously. Small, sweet, and deeply empathic, she longs for someone who will respect her boundaries. Her safe space is her own presence.</p>

            <h1>Jaythan</h1>
            <p>Jaythan was born to a single mother in the Day Court. There were always complications with his health, but when he was 9 years old, his illness brought him to death's door. His mother pleaded with every deity, good and bad, ancient and modern, forbidden and worshiped. And only one responded. Kreis, a forgotten, formerly forbidden death spirit. He made a deal with Jaythan's mother: what they loved most for Jaythan's life. She agreed too hastily and Kreis took his mother's life and inhabited Jaythan's vacated mind. Jaythan was returned to health and is unable to die--the part of the deal that guaranteed his "life"--but he tried. He now exists on both the mortal plain and the plains of death. Kreis's residence in his mind is mostly dormant, but sometimes it will show in a flash of his eyes or a cruel comment. He became an entity of death and darkness beyond that of the night. As he was now the antithesis of the Day Court in which he was from, he was quickly exiled to the Unspoken Court and accused of murdering his mother. He is now one of the most ancient beings in the Unspoken Court. He has spectral abilities to see into the death realm like a transparent layer atop the mortal plain, and can manipulate shadows and spectral essence to do his bidding. He is trauma incarnate and does not believe there is healing for him.</p>

            <h1>Fynn</h1>
            <p>A nonbinary Spring Court survivor, Fynn is a radiant ball of sunshine by day and a ghost of grief during storms. Their race uses photosynthesis magic—sunlight empowers them, while thunderstorms strip them of it, leaving them wilted, fragile, and reliving trauma. As a child, their village was raided during a storm, leaving Fynn the sole survivor. A fae farming couple found them curled beside their dead parents, unresponsive. They adopted Fynn and gave them a greenhouse room. Fynn has no memory of the attack during daylight—the sun heals mind and body—but during storms, the trauma floods back. Emrys found them sobbing during one such storm, glowing faintly in a hollow tree, and stayed by their side.</p>
